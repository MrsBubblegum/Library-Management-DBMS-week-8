# Library-Management-DBMS-week-8
Design and implement a full-featured database using only MySQL.

# üìö Library Management System

## üìñ Project Description
The **Library Management System** is a MySQL-based relational database designed to efficiently manage library resources. It tracks books, members, borrowing activities, book authors, categories, and the librarians who manage transactions.

This database supports:
- Member registration and tracking
- Book inventory with authors and categories
- Borrowing and returning of books
- Librarian accountability
- Many-to-many relationships (Books ‚Üî Authors, Books ‚Üî Categories)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Requirements:
- MySQL installed (used MySQL Workbench to write code)

### To Run:
1. Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench).
2. Create a new database (e.g., `CREATE DATABASE library_db;`).
3. Select the database: `USE library_db;`
4. Copy and paste the contents of the `.sql` file into the SQL editor.
5. Execute the SQL script to create all tables and relationships.

That's it! Database is now ready for use.

## Sample query

SELECT 
    b.title AS book_title,
    m.first_name AS member_first_name,
    m.last_name AS member_last_name,
    br.borrow_date,
    br.return_date
FROM 
    Borrowings br
JOIN 
    Books b ON br.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN 
    Members m ON br.member_id = m.member_id
WHERE 
    br.return_date IS NULL;
